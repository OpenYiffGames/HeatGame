# Auth Patcher

OwO what is this? This is a tool that automatically patches the paywall system (hopefully) on any game version after 0.6.5.1.

## Why, you may ask
Well, as you can see, I can't afford to manually write patches for every single game release, so a tool that does that for me solves this issue

## How to build
- Have the latest version of the .Net 8.0 installed
- Visual Studio 2022
- Set build to `release` with `x64` target
- build the solution

## How to use it
- Run the executable and choose the game main executable or run the patcher by dragging the game executable to it
- Wait for it to do its magic
- Enjoy!
